## Status
**Completed:**
* Verify servers support partial downloads using Range Headers.
* Loading JSON.
* Downloading a file in parts, saving progress in a smart way.
* Interrupted download resuming
* Version checking as done in the original patcher


**What I'm currently working on:**
* extracting downloaded files/patching source files

**TODO:**
* Make a "remove bloat-files" function
* Allow access to a progress function
* Adding a few more Sha256 checks at certain locations

**What requires love/suggestions:**
* C API (function names and parameters)
* Flowcharts
